# Software Engineer - Fullstack programmer
As an experienced developer, I've sharpened my skills in a host of programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript and Python, while also immersing myself in the nuances of Rust.

I have effectively applied JavaScript and TypeScript in industry-leading frameworks like React and NextJS, and further extended my TypeScript competence with NestJS and Fastify, leveraging both GraphQL and REST API.

My technical acumen spans various tools such as Git, Linux, Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes, equipping me to easily navigate and control complex technical environments.

Furthermore, I am adept at handling SQL and MongoDB databases, demonstrating my versatility in interacting with diverse database management systems.

I am a highly adaptable programmer, with a strong motivational drive and practical communication skills. My commitment to continuous learning propels me to constantly broaden my technical skill set in the dynamic landscape of computer science.
