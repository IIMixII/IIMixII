# Software Engineer - Fullstack programmer
As all programmers, I consider myself a highly motivated individual that can thrive in new situations and easily communicate my thoughts in a logical way. I am interested in learning and will continue to develop my skills in computer science.

- Experienced in many languages (IRL too) as JavaScript, Typescript, Python, Java, SQL and currently learning Rust.
- I worked with frameworks as React(JS & TS), NestJS with Graphql and REST API (TS), NextJS (JS & TS), GTK (Python) and many more to come.
- Finally, I have also used the following technologies: Git (Of course), Linux, Docker and docker-compose, Kubernetes and MongoDB.
